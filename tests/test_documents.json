This decision is pursuant to the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Civil Nuclear Credit Program Proposed Award of Credits to Pacific Gas and Electric Company for Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DOE/EIS-0555). DCPP is an existing commercial nuclear power plant located in San Luis Obispo County, California.

The action awards credits to PG&E to help DCPP to continue to operate under the existing NRC approved licenses and programs.

Project activities likely to result in incidental take include impact pile driving and site assessment surveys using high-resolution geophysical (HRG) equipment.

The proposed updates are related to six existing footnotes. The ICAPS Program convenes health professionals to develop draft recommendations for HRSA's consideration. Twenty-five respondents provided comments which were received and considered as detailed below. On December 29, 2023, HRSA accepted as final the ICAPS Program's recommended update to the six footnotes. None of the footnote updates change the HRSA-supported clinical recommendations and therefore none of these updates make any changes to coverage without cost-sharing, as each of the footnotes merely update references to the supporting evidence base for existing recommendations or adds additional descriptive text.

Generally, this is an expedited process by which agencies may obtain OMB's approval of collection of information requests that are ``usually voluntary, low-burden, and uncontroversial collections,'' do not raise any substantive or policy issues, and do not require policy or methodological review. The process requires the submission of an overarching plan that defines the scope of the individual collections that would fall under its umbrella. On October 23, 2011, OMB approved our initial request to use the generic clearance process under control number 0938-1148 (CMS-10398). It was last approved on April 26, 2021, via the standard PRA process which included the publication of 60- and 30-day Federal Register notices. The scope of the April 2021 umbrella accounts for Medicaid and CHIP State plan amendments, waivers, demonstrations, and reporting. This Federal Register notice seeks public comment on one or more of our collection of information requests that we believe are generic and fall within the scope of the umbrella.

PFAS are a group of chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s because of their useful properties, such as water and stain resistance. Many PFAS break down very slowly and can build up in people, animals, and the environment over time. Exposure at certain levels to specific PFAS can adversely impact human health and other living things. Persons subject to the final SNUR are required to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacture (including import) or processing of the chemical substance for a significant new use. Once EPA receives a notification, EPA must review and make an affirmative determination on the notification, and take such action as is required by any such determination before the manufacture (including import) or processing for the significant new use can commence. Such a review will assess whether the new use may present unreasonable risk to health or the environment and ensure that EPA takes appropriate action as required to protect health or the environment.","action":"Final rule.","agencies":[{"raw_name":"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY","name":"Environmental Protection Agency","id":145,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145","parent_id":null,"slug":"environmental-protection-agency"}],"agency_names":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"body_html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2024/01/11/2024-00412.html","cfr_references":[{"chapter":null,"citation_url":null,"part":9,"title":40},{"chapter":null,"citation_url":null,"part":721,"title":40}],"citation":"89 FR 1822","comment_url":null,"comments_close_on":null,"correction_of":null,"corrections":[],"dates":"This final rule is effective March 11, 2024.

In addition, the Commission is adopting additional amendments to the Covered Clearing Agency Standards with respect to risk management. These requirements are designed to protect investors, reduce risk, and increase operational efficiency. Finally, the Commission is amending the broker-dealer customer protection rule to permit margin required and on deposit with covered clearing agencies for U.S. Treasury securities to be included as a debit in the reserve formulas for accounts of customers and proprietary accounts of broker-dealers (``PAB''), subject to certain conditions.","action":"Final rule.","agencies":[{"raw_name":"SECURITIES

The Commission is also proposing to amend certain of its regulations applicable to SDs, in areas including the required timing of certain notifications, the process for approval of subordinated debt for capital, and the revision of financial reporting forms to conform to the rules.

This will also reduce the amount of time it takes for survivors to apply either online, or through a call center, therefore allowing call center agents to assist survivors more quickly.","action":"30-Day notice of revision and request for comments.","agencies":[{"raw_name":"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY","name":"Homeland Security Department","id":227,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/homeland-security-department","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/227","parent_id":null,"slug":"homeland-security-department"},{"raw_name":"FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY","name":"Federal Emergency Management Agency","id":166,"url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/federal-emergency-management-agency","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/166","parent_id":227,"slug":"federal-emergency-management-agency"}],"agency_names":["Homeland Security Department","Federal Emergency Management Agency"],"body_html_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2024/01/16/2024-00673.html","cfr_references":[],"citation":"89 FR 2634","comment_url":null,"comments_close_on":"2024-02-15","correction_of":null,"corrections":[],"dates":"Comments must be submitted on or before February 15, 2024.","disposition_notes":null,"docket_id":"Docket ID: FEMA-2023-0028","docket_ids":["Docket ID: FEMA-2023-0028","OMB No. 1660-0002"],"dockets":[{"supporting_documents":[],"agency_name":"FEMA","documents":[{"comment_count":null,"comment_start_date":null,"updated_at":"2024-01-16T10:00:37.375-05:00","comment_url":"https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/FEMA-2023-0028-0002","allow_late_comments":null,"id":"FEMA-2023-0028-0002","comment_end_date":null,"regulations_dot_gov_open_for_comment":false}],"supporting_documents_count":0,"id":"FEMA-2023-0028","title":"Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Disaster Assistance Registration"}],"document_number":"2024-00673","effective_on":null,"end_page":2636,"excerpts":"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
